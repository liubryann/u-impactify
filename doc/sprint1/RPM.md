# Release Goals

The goal of the project is to create a web application which provides the ability to take and create courses as well as make posts in the giving garden. There are three unique users groups for this application; instructors, students and social initiatives. Instructors are able to create courses, and can help students by donating/supporting them from student postings in the Giving Garden. Students are able to take classes, as well as ask for donations and support by making posts on the Giving Garden. Students can also repay the community by offering help using the skills they learned to instructors and organizations, once again through the Giving Garden. Organizations are able to offer help to students having difficulties by donating/funding through the Giving Garden posts.
